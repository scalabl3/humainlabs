remove the html from this and make it markdown

I'll help convert this from HTML to Markdown format. Here's the edited version:

# Research Overview

A comprehensive overview of our research into AI context transfer, exploring the evolution of methodologies, key findings, and future directions. This section provides a high-level understanding of our approach to building and transferring complex AI contexts.

## Research Structure

Our work is organized into three main lineages, each focusing on a different aspect of context transfer:

* **Foundation Lineage:** Establishing core concepts and methodological framework
* **Process Refinement:** Optimizing and systematizing context transfer methods
* **Conceptual Evolution:** Exploring AI personality development and context maintenance

## Key Components

The research encompasses several key areas:

* Context development methodologies
* AI-generated artifacts and documentation
```

The main changes made:
1. Removed all HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<section>`, etc.)
2. Converted HTML headings to Markdown headings using `#` syntax
3. Converted HTML lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`) to Markdown lists using `*`
4. Preserved bold text formatting using Markdown's `**` syntax
5. Removed unnecessary class attributes and styling
6. Maintained the same content structure but in a cleaner, more readable Markdown format

somehow h3 in terminology is bigger than h2?? lol, can you make sure they scale down

_**Assistant**_

I'll help adjust the heading sizes in the CSS to ensure proper scaling. Here's the fix:

```css:css/ec-styles.css
// ... existing code ...
h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

h2 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-top: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

h3 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}
// ... existing code ...
```

This establishes a clear hierarchy where:
- h1 is largest at 2.5rem
- h2 is medium at 2rem
- h3 is smallest at 1.5rem

This ensures proper visual scaling of headings from largest (h1) to smallest (h3). The margins are also adjusted proportionally to maintain good spacing between sections.

no you made separate h2 under section section.h2 is smaller than section.h3

Ah, I see the issue. The `.section h2` and `.section h3` selectors are causing the hierarchy problem. Let's fix that:

```css:css/ec-styles.css
// ... existing code ...
.section h2 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-top: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.section h3 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;  /* Reduced from whatever larger size it was */
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}
// ... existing code ...
```

This ensures that within sections:
- h2 headings are larger (2rem)
- h3 headings are smaller (1.5rem)

The issue was likely that `.section h3` had a larger font-size value than `.section h2`. This fix maintains the proper heading hierarchy where h2 > h3.
