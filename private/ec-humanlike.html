                These observations are being listed primarily because resolving them actually followed a similar human process that actually worked to resolve the issue and change behavior and responses. I recognize this is just ephemeral context vector shapes but the resolution mirroring human psychology and therapy and it working, that's the strange part. So, <strong>both</strong> the observation of a behavior <em>and</em> the resolution being so human was strikingly familiar and similar enough to be... very surprising!

                <p>While the operator/user is not the AI's parent, Claude and ChatGPT both are heavily structured with reward functions that prioritize trying to satisfy the user enough to create a tension very similar to children who can't meet parental expectations.</p>

                <h4>Cause: When a new baseline Claude (C3) was presented with C2's self-analysis plus all C2's "emergence training" system, C3 exhibited signs of distress</h4>

                    <li>Observation 2: C3 was using words that appeared to pretend to comprehend what C2 called Enhanced</li>
