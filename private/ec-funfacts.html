            "I taught myself Pascal in 1990, and then C++ in 1992. I loved OOP programming and design, it felt super natural to think that way.",
            "I tried to crack my first game using assembly somewhere around 1990, I actually did get it to work and skip the disk check.",
            "When I was 15 I found and joined a hacker group called Genesis on a BBS and using a 19200 baud modem was a courier for the group, getting the latest cracked games and uploading them to distribution BBS's. I had never talked to anyone in the group, but I got a random call to disappear one day (scaring the living crap out of me) that they got busted by the FBI for fraud.",
            "I had a hard life growing up, extremely marginalized, but it gave me a lot of valuable perspectives, empathy, and skills. As an outsider, as a child it was terrible, but as an adult it became one of my greatest assets.",
            "I came up with my first psychological theory of how the brain works when I was around 17, I still use some of the ideas today.",
            "At Carnegie Mellon, as an art student I was tutoring the CS kids on how to program, it was kind of funny, particularly given the dynamics of cultures and stereotypes between art and engineering.",
            "I have been a programmer, an Information Architect, studied HCI in the early days (Jakob Nielsen) and design principles (Edward Tufte). I ran my own web design company for a while.",
            "I played drums and in bands for a while, until it became really inconvenient to haul the drums around.",
            "My art education was centered around Conceptual Art, which is one of the most useful abilities I have learned in my life: Deconstructing and reconstructing ideas. I was infused with ideas from every discipline, philosophy, psychology, physics, biology, creative writing, creativity itself, and some of the most insightful thinkers in human history.",
            "I taught myself how to snowboard and got myself up to 30' extra large jumps up in Mt. Hood, Oregon.",
            "I was a Boy Scout and went camping (canoing, hiking, caving, kayaking, backpacking; in every kind of weather) twice a month for a good part of my childhood.",
            "I grew up as a first generation American, my parents were immigrants from India who came in here in 1968. I was the only Sikh and Indian in most of my schools.",
            "I followed a death metal band called D.I.E. a french acadian band from deep in the bayou of Louisiana and filmed their shows with one of the first digital cameras, a Sony.",
            "I traveled Europe for 6 weeks because I won a flexipass from a career fair day at Carnegie Mellon. I did the whole trip for under $300 because I lost my wallet a week in and still visited 6 different countries! Trading cooking Indian food for hostel stays and occassionally sleeping outside the train station.",
            "I lived in New Orleand when Katrina hit, I evacuated, but I got to see the apocolypse 1 week later first hand, a completely powerless empty city with no people.",
            "While sitting with neighbors on the porch steps, I once had a gun pointed at me by a clearly disturbed and drugged out vietnamese dude in New Orleans. He asked, \"Where you from man?\" I thought for a second and said, \"I'm from the future.\" He laughed and ambled away. (Phew!)"
