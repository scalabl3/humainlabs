                <h3>Process Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    I have only known disambiguity once in my career. In my mid 20's after the first Internet bubble burst, despite only having programming experience, I persuaded a popular Asian Fusion restaurant in Atlanta to hire me as a wok chef. That role was the most direct "this is your job" type I have ever had. I was responsible for two blazing-hot woks and twelve fast-paced dishes that required precise timing. Every dish took a different amount of time, overlapping starts, finishes and discrete steps. It was a constant optimization of a large superset of recombinative stages, process, and timing. There was always some variability to adapt to--  the flame heat and blanching time, the thickness of the vegetables cut, and unpredictable mistakes by others. In between dancing woks it was camaraderie and joking around with my sous chefs who assembled the raw ingredients and finished my off creations with sprinkles of sesame seeds, cilantro, or peanuts. For 6 hours every night, I focused on optimizing, multitasking and executing each different process, so that it assembled perfectly. I was really good at it, I think I only got the timing wrong a handful times. It was one of my favorite jobs.

                    Ambiguity is really the pulling of many different forces at once. Each force has the commonality of not being clearly defined, ordered, and understood. These forces have several holonic levels: the individual, the group, between groups, between departments, between the organization and the market, and between now and the future. These forces multiply from both bottom-up, inside-out perspectives, and vice versa. Outside of factory line work, everyone has to weigh all these push/pull complexities constantly. Entropy and Order are the dancing woks.

                <p>
                    The role of a manager is to shield the team from having to weigh all of these ambiguity levels simultaneously. If everyone has to deal with all of them, the collective ambiguity can easily fall into traps of paralysis and misalignment. As a manager, I focus on asking the right questions, not giving all the answers. From the outside-in, I ask the right questions to ensure requirements for my team are defined clearly, with the correct metrics for success. Grom the inside-out I make sure to ask the right questions to help the individuals find clarity and match both their own objectives to larger ones. I also take the burden and weight off the team so they can be themselves, to have the ingenuity that makes them, well them.

                <p>
                    For the last 15 years at EMC2, Harness, PubNub and Couchbase, the demands of my role were always about optimization in high-pressure environments. Each was a combination of different requirements for success, all nebulous and complex. There was no formula that always worked all the time, like a toolbox there are a myriad of ways to accomplish goals. My role in each had a commonality that has been a cornerstone of my whole career: Providing leadership, grounding and process -- breaking problems down into smaller steps that could be solved. By defining objectives collectively, mentoring their progress, and aligning work to the myriad of stakeholders who had different priorities, personalities, and timing. My approach was a combination of waterfall and agile: every large objective has a concrete final output, but the adaptation to reach that required balancing the multitude of skills, strengths, weaknesses and personalities.

                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>I've always found one aspect of Coach Belichick to be really inspiring. Taking on a struggling New England Patriots, he became the most successful football coach of all time. Reknown for using data and intuition together to identify later round draft picks with potential, and then coaching them to be the best in the league. There was no hype around the players, no projecting of superhuman qualities by the media and others, Belichick just looked for what their talents were, <i>and what they could be</i>. Tom Brady was one of them, a 6th round draft pick that was overlooked by nearly everyone. He became the greatest quarterback of all time. It was no fluke, leaving the Patriots after 20 seasons, at age 43, in his first season in Tampa Bay-- he took the team to the Superbowl and won it. However, it's not a tale of two inevitabilities, it's a tale of how they both achieved this together. Sometimes the best talent isn't always evident on paper. </p>
                <p>It's always difficult to attract and identify the right talent. Building a team under deep financial constraints, and not having the perks like extra generous salaris, free meals, and iron chefs in the cafeterias of other Silicon Valley giants, I had to approach it differently. Instead of choosing from a giant pool of qualified candidates, I had to identify raw talent in the less experience and develop it. This wasn't always easy, and there were times I had to adapt and do a lot of 1-1 training and tutoring. Sometimes it was on interpersonal skills, other times technical depth, and other times systemic thinking on how to approach complex customer/stakeholder needs. It was worth it, many became superstars in the organization! In the process, I learned new ways to guide talents, what works best, what doesn't. Being perpetually understaffed led to optimizaiton in creative ways. Similar to using shared libraries in programming as a foundation for multiple application and business tiers, I had to constantly find ways to have limited resources produce the most impact not just on my teams, but across the organization. These challenges taught me a considerable amount about how to grow, mentor and get the most out of my teams.</p>
