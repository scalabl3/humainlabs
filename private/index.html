                <h3>Process Optimization: Ambiguity and Disambiguity</h3>
                <p>I have only known disambiguity once in my career. In my mid 20's after the first Internet bubble burst, despite only having programming experience, I persuaded a popular Asian Fusion restaurant in Atlanta to hire me as a wok chef. That role was the most direct "this is your job" type I have ever had. I was responsible for two blazing-hot woks and twelve fast-paced dishes that required precise timing. Every dish took a different amount of time, overlapping starts, finishes and discrete steps. It was a constant optimization of a large superset of recombinative stages, process, and timing. There was always some variability to adapt to--  the flame heat and blanching time, the thickness of the vegetables cut, and unpredictable mistakes by others. In between dancing woks it was camaraderie and joking around with my sous chefs who assembled the raw ingredients and finished my off creations with sprinkles of sesame seeds, cilantro, or peanuts. For 6 hours every night, I focused on optimizing, multitasking and executing each different process, so that it assembled perfectly. I was really good at it, I think I only got the timing wrong a handful times. It was one of my favorite jobs.</p>
                
                <p>Ambiguity is really the pulling of many different forces at once. Each force has the commonality of not being clearly defined, ordered, and understood. These forces have several holonic levels: the individual, the group, between groups, between departments, between the organization and the market, and between now and the future. These forces multiply from both bottom-up, inside-out perspectives, and vice versa. Outside of factory line work, everyone has to weigh all these push/pull complexities constantly. Entropy and Order are the dancing woks.</p>
                
                <p>The role of a manager is to shield the team from having to weigh all of these ambiguity levels simultaneously. If everyone has to deal with all of them, the collective ambiguity can easily fall into traps of paralysis and misalignment. As a manager, I focus on asking the right questions, not giving all the answers. From the outside-in, I ask the right questions to ensure requirements for my team are defined clearly, with the correct metrics for success. Grom the inside-out I make sure to ask the right questions to help the individuals find clarity and match both their own objectives to larger ones. I also take the burden and weight off the team so they can be themselves, to have the ingenuity that makes them, well them.</p>
                
                <p>For the last 15 years at EMC2, Harness, PubNub and Couchbase, the demands of my role were always about optimization in high-pressure environments. Each was a combination of different requirements for success, all nebulous and complex. There was no formula that always worked all the time, like a toolbox there are a myriad of ways to accomplish goals. My role in each had a commonality that has been a cornerstone of my whole career: Providing leadership, grounding and process -- breaking problems down into smaller steps that could be solved. By defining objectives collectively, mentoring their progress, and aligning work to the myriad of stakeholders who had different priorities, personalities, and timing. My approach was a combination of waterfall and agile: every large objective has a concrete final output, but the adaptation to reach that required balancing the multitude of skills, strengths, weaknesses and personalities.</p>

                <h3>Failure and Resilience</h3>
                <p>We learn a lot from success, but we learn even more from failures.</p>
                
                <p>Let's think meta for 60 seconds: In the standard Resume and Interview processes, it feels a bit backwards. The candidate tries to make the most glowing bulletproof resume of non-stop success and achievement, far from how success works, by trying to appear infallible and impenetrable. The interviewers are trying to find the real person behind the presentation -- doing mental calculus to evaluate whether each candidate matches what they need, what the culture needs, what the role needs -- both now and in the unknown future. The candidate is trying to hide and spin every failure and misalignment into a beautiful but false reality of what things were [never] like. It's no one's fault, it's been like this a long time-- one of the least disrupted processes of the last 100 years, because it is a difficult problem to solve. The only other one just like it is dating, but even that, people are at least trying to disrupt.</p>
                
                <p>I would rather write a book about how each company I worked for managed to find ways to do a hundred things wrong, rather than glorifying the fifty successes each found. Not that I'm not a positive person, actually, this is the way in which I find optimism -- by tackling problems that are true and real, not pretending they're not there. In fact, our human social nature revels in collective building of solutions. Success != 1 working lightbulb. Success == 1000 lightbulb failures + 1 working lightbulb. I won't hide the 1000 failed lightbulbs from you, otherwise you won't learn why I know how to avoid 1000 lightbulbs failing.</p>
                
                <p>Resilience is perseverence in adversity, and successes alone cannot tell you enough about the adversity!</p>
                
                <p>I've always found one aspect of Coach Belichick to be really inspiring. Taking on a struggling team the New England Patriots, he became the most successful football coaches of all time. He became renown for finding later round draft picks and coaching them to be the best in the league. There was no hype around the players, no projecting of inhuman qualities by the media and others, Belichick just looked for what their talents were, <em>and what they could be</em>. Tom Brady was one of them, a 6th round draft pick that was overlooked by nearly everyone. He became the greatest quarterback of all time. It was no fluke, leaving the Patriots after 20 seasons, at age 43, in his first season in Tampa Bay-- he took the team to the Superbowl and won it. However, it's not a tale of two inevitabilities, it's a tale of how they both achieved this together. Sometimes the best talent isn't always what's on paper. What makes 4 people The Beatles, or The Shaggs.</p>
                
                <p>I didn't work at the most incredibly commercially successful companies, with nearly infinite budgets and perks to spare. Instead we had to compete for talent against the other silicon valley companies that offered free meals, generous per diem travel allotments, free gym memberships and iron chefs in the cafeterias. This meant we couldn't offer the salaries and benefits to attract the most experienced talent, and instead we had to develop talents in the less experienced. This wasn't always easy, and not always successful, and I have seen a lot of parallels in building skills in AI.</p>
                
                <p>In my storied career, I worked at companies that all had different trajectories, pacing, success, and failures. The stories just weren't fairy tales. From the outside, success is measured by revenue and revenue growth. Inside it's about the humans coming together and finding ways to work together, work together better, and "skate to where the puck is going," when everyone sees a different puck. Often meandering somewhere between working like a brand new car on one extreme, and one that needs to be scrapped for parts on the other, it's a balancing act of quantitative and qualitative measurement, culture, opportunities, worklife balance, and effective collaboration.</p>
