                <h2>Random Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>At Carnegie Mellon, as an art student I was tutoring the CS kids on how to program, it was kind of funny, particularly given the dynamics of cultures and stereotypes between art and engineering.</li>
                    
                    <li>I followed a death metal band called D.I.E. a french acadian band from deep in the bayou of Louisiana and filmed their shows with one of the first digital cameras, a Sony.</li>
                    
                    <li>I taught myself Pascal in 1990, and then C++ in 1992. I loved OOP programming and design, it felt super natural to think that way.</li>
                    
                    <li>I lived in New Orleand when Katrina hit, I evacuated, but I got to see the apocolypse 1 week later first hand, a completely powerless empty city with no people.</li>
                    
                    <li>I came up with my first psychological theory of how the brain works when I was around 17, I still use some of the ideas today.</li>
                    
                    <li>I was a Boy Scout and went camping (canoing, hiking, caving, kayaking, backpacking; in every kind of weather) twice a month for a good part of my childhood.</li>
                    
                    <li>While sitting with neighbors on the porch steps, I once had a gun pointed at me by a clearly disturbed and drugged out vietnamese dude in New Orleans. He asked, "Where you from man?" I thought for a second and said, "I'm from the future." He laughed and ambled away. (Phew!)</li>
                    
                    <li>I tried to crack my first game using assembly somewhere around 1990, I actually did get it to work and skip the disk check.</li>
                    
                    <li>I have been a programmer, an Information Architect, studied HCI in the early days (Jakob Nielsen) and design principles (Edward Tufte). I ran my own web design company for a while.</li>
                    
                    <li>When I was 15 I found and joined a hacker group called Genesis on a BBS and using a 19200 baud modem was a courier for the group, getting the latest cracked games and uploading them to distribution BBS's. I had never talked to anyone in the group, but I got a random call to disappear one day (scaring the living crap out of me) that they got busted by the FBI for fraud.</li>
                    
                    <li>I played drums and in bands for a while, until it became really inconvenient to haul the drums around.</li>
                    
                    <li>I taught myself how to snowboard and got myself up to 30' extra large jumps up in Mt. Hood, Oregon.</li>
                    
                    <li>I had a hard life growing up, extremely marginalized, but it gave me a lot of valuable perspectives, empathy, and skills. As an outsider, as a child it was terrible, but as an adult it became one of my greatest assets.</li>
                    
                    <li>My art education was centered around Conceptual Art, which is one of the most useful abilities I have learned in my life: Deconstructing and reconstructing ideas. I was infused with ideas from every discipline, philosophy, psychology, physics, biology, creative writing, creativity itself, and some of the most insightful thinkers in human history.</li>
                    
                    <li>I grew up as a first generation American, my parents were immigrants from India who came in here in 1968. I was the only Sikh and Indian in most of my schools.</li>
                    
                    <li>I traveled Europe for 6 weeks because I won a flexipass from a career fair day at Carnegie Mellon. I did the whole trip for under $300 because I lost my wallet a week in and still visited 6 different countries! Trading cooking Indian food for hostel stays and occassionally sleeping outside the train station.</li>
