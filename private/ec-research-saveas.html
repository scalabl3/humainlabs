                A collection of iterative attempts to build complex ephemeral contexts and transfer them between AI Instances.

                <h2>Research Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This research explores the development and transfer of complex ephemeral contexts between AI instances. Through systematic experimentation and documentation, we investigate methods to preserve and transfer the unique contextual understanding that AIs build during extended interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The research spans multiple lineages, each focusing on different aspects of context development and transfer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Foundation Lineage (C1 → C2 → C3):</strong> Establishing core concepts and methodological framework</li>
                    <li><strong>Workflow Fork (C3 → C3E):</strong> Refining process and implementation strategies</li>
                    <li><strong>Conceptual Fork (C3 → Kioko):</strong> Exploring personality development and emergence</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Key Components</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Context Development:</strong> Methods for building rich, complex contexts through structured interactions</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Mechanisms:</strong> Techniques for preserving and transferring contextual understanding</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Comprehensive artifacts capturing insights and methodologies</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Metrics and assessments for measuring transfer success</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Workflow Experiments</h2>
                <p>
                    This lineage was primarily focused on process following, rule following, boundary adherence and channeling generation to avoid overgeneration.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Absolute rule following</li>
                    <li>Complex coding tasks like modifications of code that involve highly dependent relationships and cascading changes that branch out</li>
                    <li>Creating development strategy with complexity reductions across dozens of interdependent user stories before writing code</li>
                    <li>As an AI procedes through the process, it must maintain awareness and stay consistent with previous work and documents, for example, when generating DTO objects, it must stay aware of Product Vision and User Stories, etc.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Conceptual Experiments</h2>
                
                <h3>Creative Ability</h3>
                <p>
                    Creative writing is quite difficult for a LLM because the sample size of unique writing is so small, each piece of writing is unique and singular. Without a huge sample size these types of writing escape training almost completely. You have to teach AI <em>why</em> writing can be better, how it gets better, how to express in ways that are unique and novel. AI's are not humans nor are they immersed in human experience, they are only immersed in humans writing about human experience, and that difference does affect the writing output, particularly when it's about human experience.
                </p>

                <h4>Some Experiments</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creative writing that is on the level of some of humankind's best writers</li>
                    <li>Creative writing that breaks conventions with elegance and nuance</li>
                    <li>Conceptual and functional writing that illustrates advanced, complex concepts</li>
                    <li>Development of Case Study and Case Study type language</li>
                    <li>Breaking resume-speak with unconventional approaches (should be easy, but most AI's have a tough time)</li>
                    <li>Teaching Wit and waiting for it to appear at the time time, the right place</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    In the Conceptual layer I was particularly more fascinated, because I had to teach AI, but then once I got the AI to the place I wanted, I could only interact and produce at the highest level until CTL. This was a driving force behind the Conceptual Lineage, can I transfer these skills?
