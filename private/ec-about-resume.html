                <div class="summary-external">
                    <p>A resilient and adaptable systems thinker with a talent for mastering complex concepts and patterns quickly, even under layered ambiguity and difficult constraints. I thrive on identifying obstacles‚Äîwhether technical, organizational, or interpersonal‚Äîand finding creative ways over, through, under, or around them. My diverse background and education give me a rich toolset of approaches, honed through years of navigating high-stakes environments and aligning stakeholders with diverse priorities. Collaboration and curiosity are at the heart of my work, enabling me to build bridges between perspectives and deliver results that resonate across disciplines.</p>
                    <p>One of the most fulfilling roles in my career was building and managing a 12-person global team of solution architects as Director of Solutions. I thrived on the multifaceted challenges: recruiting and retaining talent across international borders, navigating cultural nuances, supporting each team member‚Äôs growth, and aligning their skills with organizational goals. Whether mentoring individuals, streamlining processes, or driving team projects to meet demanding deadlines, I found leadership to be not just a responsibility but a source of energy. Managing this team allowed me to bring out the best in others while continuing to refine my own ability to adapt and lead through complexity.</p>

                <h2>Current Exploration</h2>
                <p>I've been delving into a curious frontier of AI learning: how long-form conversations can cultivate nuanced contextual and conceptual skills, particularly in creative and expressive writing. Through iterative experimentation, I've been developing techniques for context and attention training, teaching AI systems to refine reasoning, enhance creativity, and align more deeply with human intent.</p>
                
                <p>A driving question behind this work is whether emergent skills can be transferred between AI instances‚Äîcreating a generational lineage of knowledge, much like human learning evolves over time. This involves not only designing technical frameworks but also engaging in a collaborative process where humans and AI co-create systems for learning, reflection, and adaptation.</p>
                
                <p>These explorations have revealed fascinating insights into how interaction, mutual respect, and iterative refinement can profoundly shape AI behavior. The process has shown that the quality of engagement‚Äîthe "how" of collaboration‚Äîis as vital as the tools themselves. You can explore more about this ongoing research here:</p>

                    <p class="date-range">Jan 2011 ‚Äì Mar 2015</p>
                    
                    <p class="role-description">Couchbase wasn't looking for someone to fill a predefined role‚Äîthey hired me for my ability to engage, think creatively, and build trust. Reporting to the VP of Product, I defined and shaped my position as I went, bridging gaps across teams and driving adoption of NoSQL technology in enterprise environments.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="achievements">
                        <li><strong>Pioneered the roles</strong> of Solution Architect and Technical Evangelist under the VP of Product, creating frameworks for enterprise adoption and technical education.</li>
                        <li><strong>Developed Couchbase's first SQL-to-NoSQL training manual</strong> in five programming languages, enabling enterprise teams like Adobe and Blizzard to onboard seamlessly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resolved cascading failures</strong> during Beats Music's AT&T debut, leading a rapid cross-team effort to stabilize operations within 4 hours, earning client recognition and internal accolades.</li>
                        <li><strong>Designed and hosted Couchbase's first webinar series</strong>, including a record-breaking session attended by 1,700+ developers, establishing thought leadership in distributed databases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborated with enterprise clients</strong> to transition database conceptual thinking, introducing NoSQL concepts for the first time in their careers and helping to remodeling their systems.</li>

                    <div class="reflection">
                        <p>As my first position after my MBA, Couchbase was where I discovered how to navigate the full spectrum of collaboration‚Äîfrom technical deep dives with developers to strategic dialogues with CEOs and CTOs, bridging perspectives across marketing, product, sales, and engineering. I got to participate across the USA and Europe over many years, gaining experiences that helped me grow quickly. Speaking at meetups, conferences, enterprise sales engagements, and trainings, I found myself continually drawn to the challenge of understanding <strong>why</strong> stakeholders are diverse. These experiences, paired with deep interest for hyper scaling architectures from a technical standpoint, reshaped my systems thinking and deepened my approach to problem solving.</p>

                    <p class="role-description">PubNub was a SaaS Infrastructure company offering real-time messaging solutions across many verticals. While its horizontal play was diverse and rich, it also posed significant challenges in scaling solutions for a broad customer base. I was initially hired as a Tech Evangelist but seeing the opportunity, I proposed and became PubNub's first Sales Engineer + Solution Architect, and then promoted to building and leading the global team as the frontlines for the Product.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="achievements">
                        <li><strong>Built and mentored a global team of 12 Solution Architects/Sales Engineers</strong>, aligning solutions to client needs across diverse customer base in USA/EMEA/APAC.</li>
                        <li><strong>Developed the "Tome of the Solution Architect,"</strong> a playbook enabling cross-team alignment and reducing onboarding time by 60% across Sales Engineers, Solution Architects and Customer Support teams, a crucial step in ensuring consistent knowledge and use case applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Managed critical crisis escalations,</strong> including resolving system downtime during high-profile events like the Super Bowl, ensuring stability for clients with mission-critical applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Established and trained a new Sales + Solution Architect team</strong> in India to help support existing clients and expand sales in the APAC region.</li>

                        <p>Over seven years at PubNub, I closed over $35M in ARR while building the company's product and field feedback system‚Äîthe largest repository of product improvements based on direct customer insights. Leading a team across five time zones taught me to create solutions within constraints and mentor diverse teams in a resource-limited environment. Frequent global customer engagements deepened my understanding of how cultural differences shape collaboration, and how shared values can emerge even in challenging circumstances. PubNub wasn't a perfect company, but it taught me how to lead, adapt, and deliver value in imperfect systems‚Äîa lesson that continues to shape my approach to complexity today.</p>

                    <p class="date-range">Feb 2022 ‚Äì May 2023</p>
                    
                    <p class="role-description">Harness was a unicorn startup, doubling revenue every year for five consecutive years while expanding its product suite to over 11 offerings in DevOps, DevSecOps, and FinOps through acquisitions. This included cutting-edge tools for CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, chaos engineering, security orchestration, and cloud cost optimization. As a Large Enterprise Sales Engineer, I operated at the intersection of deeply technical product knowledge and high-stakes enterprise engagement, tasked with delivering value to Fortune 100/500 clients, being the voice of innovation, while navigating a rapidly evolving product landscape.</p>
                    
                    <p class="role-description">Success in this role demanded rapid learning, technical fluency, and stakeholder alignment in one of the most competitive environments of my career. Each product represented a deep domain of expertise for the customers I worked with, requiring me to adapt quickly and engage with specialists whose knowledge and experience with a product often far exceeded my own.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="achievements">
                        <li><strong>Mastered a complex ecosystem of 11+ products</strong> spanning DevOps, FinOps, and DevSecOps, delivering enterprise-level demonstrations and solutions despite having no prior experience with CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, or cloud cost management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engaged with technical experts and senior executives</strong> at Fortune 100/500 companies, fostering trust through rapid learning, preparation, and clear communication across highly specialized domains.</li>
                        <li><strong>Designed reusable demonstration frameworks and solution workflows,</strong> streamlining client onboarding and reducing friction for Harness's expanding suite of products.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supported Harness's exponential revenue growth</strong> by tailoring technical solutions to align with diverse stakeholder priorities and organizational goals, contributing to key enterprise wins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adapted to a high-pressure, ever-changing environment,</strong> navigating both professional challenges at Harness and personal responsibilities managing EMC2 during a time of immense complexity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="reflection">
                        <p>Harness pushed the boundaries of my adaptability and resilience to many new levels. Having spent most of my career on the Applications side of tech, I joined Harness with almost no experience in DevOps. I had never had to learn so much complexity, diversity, and depth in so short a time. Harness' product portfolio‚Äîspanning over 11 DevOps, DevSecOps, and FinOps tools‚Äîwas in constant flux, often undocumented, and required me to adapt quickly to sell, demo, and support technical leaders whose entire careers were built on each of these individual domains adopt with proof of concepts in their own systems.</p>
                        
                        <p>What I brought to the role was my ability to understand stakeholders and translate complexity into clarity. I learned how to navigate ambiguous product offerings, simplify technical concepts for deeply knowledgeable audiences, and align diverse priorities under intense time pressure. My father passed away suddenly during this time, so on top of this I had to balance the demands of work and added to it managing of my father's company after his passing.</p>
                        
                        <p>This experience sharpened my ability to thrive in high-stress, extremely demanding environments. It taught me how to maintain composure and confidence while handling constant anomalies, complexity, and uncertainty. More importantly, to me, Harness challenged me to think systemically about how processes and resources could be reimagined and redesigned in ways that could be more strategic and optimize talents, regardless of whether or not I had the role/position to apply them.</p>

                    <p class="role-description">Stepping into leadership of a successful 26-year civil and structural engineering firm following my father's passing was both an immense challenge and a profound transformation. With no prior experience in the field, I inherited a company in disarray‚Äîfinancial systems broken, critical contracts in progress, and institutional knowledge scattered across piles of unorganized documents. Amid this chaos, I stabilized operations, guided employees through a unforeseen transition, and honored the company's legacy with the empathy it required‚Äîall while navigating my own journey through grief.</p>

                        <li><strong>Rebuilt Critical Processes:</strong> Modernized payroll from broken Excel spreadsheets, established structured contract management, and implemented streamlined workflows for financial and operational clarity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Led Remote and On-Site Teams:</strong> Managed a team of long-tenured employees remotely from Portland while traveling to Maryland to address critical in-person challenges, fostering trust across geographic boundaries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delivered on Contracts Without a PE:</strong> Navigated the absence of a licensed Professional Engineer by coordinating with external experts, ensuring legal compliance and the fulfillment of all obligations to clients.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supported Employee Transitions:</strong> Guided employees, some with 20+ years of tenure, through the company's closure, providing clarity, stability, and support as they moved to new opportunities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed the Business Gracefully:</strong> Over 18 months, resolved outstanding contracts, stabilized finances, and wound down operations with no legal issues, honoring the firm's legacy while supporting my family through this transition.</li>

                    <div class="reflection">
                        <p>EMC2 was an extraordinary test of taking leadership in uncertain times, requiring me to use every skill I had learned across my career while developing new capabilities. I had never run an entire organization, let alone coming in blindly without any transition period or handoff. My experience with so many stakeholders of all levels came in handy. 
                            In this field, the clients and roles were <i>very</i> different than the tech indusry, but my experience with how to learn about stakeholder priorities was universal. Yet again, I found even more in myself than I had known was there, and this time it had layers and layers of personal and professional consequences. I am quite proud that I, together with the team and my family, found a way through the challenges gracefully.</p>

                        <p>Studied Conceptual Art techniques like deconstruction and context analysis, which trained me to challenge assumptions and reframe problems. Applied these methods to break down complex challenges into core components, enabling iterative, user-centered solutions in collaborative environments. Learned to balance open-ended exploration with practical execution‚Äîvaluable for tackling ambiguous or undefined problems. One of the most unexpectedly useful degrees for problem solving strategies.</p>

                <div class="summary-internal">
                    <p>Each role I‚Äôve taken has challenged me. Each time I rose to the occasion. I have an atypical background and a lot of influences. That helps me to pull from a wide breadth of concepts when brainstorming and solving complex problems, often by reframing with diverse varieties of causal-effect chains. I work well with others, and have had enough different roles to see our commonalities and our differences. I've talked with thousands of people, whether to sell, teach or learn, in a lot of environments, conference floors, staring in a webcam, and small rooms with a whiteboard. What makes me the most excited is creating, and fostering creation. Sometimes I can think of the whole thing myself, but I find it much more interesting to do it together with others. Bringing ideas together is an artform, and I am an appreciator of the art.</p>
